# Covid-Steroid-HTE
An exploratory analysis of treatment effect heterogeneity in the COVID STEROID 2 Trial using Bayesian machine learning

The file `hte-analysis-cv_AG.Rmd` replicates the paper analysis. Because the cross validation procedure to choose hyperparameters is very slow, the file `hte-analysis-cv-saved_AG.Rmd` exists to run the analysis using the saved CV selected parameters (and adds sensitivity analyses).
